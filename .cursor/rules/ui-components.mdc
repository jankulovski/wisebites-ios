# WiseBites iOS UI Components

## Main Views

### ContentView

[ContentView.swift](mdc:wisebites-ios/ContentView.swift) is the main view of the application.

Current structure:
- A `VStack` containing:
  - An `Image` displaying a globe icon
  - A `Text` displaying "Hello, world!!"
- The stack has padding applied

## Styling Patterns

The app currently uses these styling approaches:
- `.imageScale(.large)` for scaling images
- `.foregroundStyle(.tint)` for tinting elements with the system color
- `.padding()` for adding space around elements

## Preview Support

The app uses SwiftUI's `#Preview` macro to provide design-time previews of UI components. For example:

```swift
#Preview {
    ContentView()
}
```

## Asset Management

UI assets are stored in [Assets.xcassets](mdc:wisebites-ios/Assets.xcassets) and can be referenced directly in Image views.
