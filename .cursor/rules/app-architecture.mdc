# WiseBites iOS App Architecture

## Application Flow

The WiseBites iOS app follows a standard SwiftUI application structure:

1. The application starts at [wisebites_iosApp.swift](mdc:wisebites-ios/wisebites_iosApp.swift) with the `@main` attribute
2. The app struct conforms to the `App` protocol and defines the main scene
3. The main scene sets [ContentView.swift](mdc:wisebites-ios/ContentView.swift) as the root view

## Design Patterns

The app uses SwiftUI's declarative UI paradigm where:
- Views describe their appearance and behavior
- State is separated from view logic
- The view hierarchy is built using composition

## SwiftUI Components

The app primarily uses these SwiftUI components:
- `VStack`: For vertical stacking of UI elements
- `Image`: For displaying images
- `Text`: For displaying text content

## Navigation

Currently, the app has a simple single-view structure. When navigation components are added, they will be documented here.
